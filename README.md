##Features

Task Tracking: The app allows users to track whether they’ve completed tasks or milestones related to their plant. This is reflected by the plant growing from a sprout to a full-grown state.
Community: The app allows you to connect with other users and groups who are also interested in the same personal and professional finance goals.

##Key Technologies
